## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Uptime Check Discrepancy

**Status:** INVESTIGATED (Terminal execution blocked)
**Problem:** Script reports "already exists" for 22 services, but verification shows only 1 check
**Root Cause:** Terminal commands opening alternate buffer, preventing execution
**Resolution:** Script updated with improved error handling and unique check IDs
**Impact:** Monitoring coverage partial (1/22 checks), but foundation established

**Next Steps:**

1. Resolve terminal execution issues
2. Execute updated uptime script
3. Verify 22/22 uptime checks deployed
4. Complete full monitoring coverage

### Issue 2: GitHub Push Authentication

**Status:** EXPECTED (Read-only token)
**Problem:** Cannot push 8 local commits to GitHub
**Resolution:** Work preserved locally, push when write access available
**Impact:** None - all work committed and documented
