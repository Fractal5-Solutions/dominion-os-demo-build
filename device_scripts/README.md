## AI Gateway Integration

The Samsung laptop E-2139TSL can connect to Dominion AI Gateway for:
- **Remote diagnostics** and automated analysis
- **Scheduled cleanup** operations
- **Real-time monitoring** of disk space
- **Performance optimization** recommendations

### AI Gateway Endpoints
- **Primary:** https://dominion-ai-gateway-66ymegzkya-uc.a.run.app
- **Secondary:** https://dominion-ai-gateway-reduwyf2ra-uc.a.run.app

### Connection Requirements
1. Network access to the AI Gateway endpoints
2. Bearer token for authentication (GitHub PAT)
3. Ability to send POST requests with JSON payloads

## Expected Results

Typical space savings:
- **Windows:** 2-10 GB (depends on update cache, temp files, and browser usage)
- **Linux:** 1-5 GB (depends on package cache and log size)

## Safety

Both scripts are designed with safety in mind:
- ✅ Only removes temporary/cache files
- ✅ No deletion of user data or documents
- ✅ Empties Recycle Bin (files already marked for deletion)
- ✅ Lists large files for manual review (doesn't auto-delete)
- ✅ Provides before/after disk space reports
